# Derek Chan . Jarvis Consulting

From Seneca College, I graduated with a Honours Bachelor of Technology - Software Development. Throughout my years studying in the program and working at Nexolink Inc. for a co-op work term lasting close to a year, I learned practical software development technologies and skills such as Docker, Linux Shell Scripting, Agile & Scrum and software application design. My knowledge of software development includes Java, Javascript, Spring Boot, SQL, Docker, AWS/GCP, and Git/Github. Previously, my experience was related to project and processes management at a condominium development consulting company where my focus was spent streamlining workflow processes, making sure that projects were proceeding in a timely manner and managing communication between teams and execution of project phases. As a budding junior developer, I am always looking for opportunities to produce software that will assist in running my life and contributing to my career development.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-drkcn94](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-drkcn94)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-drkcn94/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a monitoring agent program using Bash scripting for recording of hardware specifications and resource utilization of linux clusters. The program was implemented using Bash scripting, Docker, PostgreSQL, and crontab. Testing of the application was done manually. Deployment of the application was done by Dockerizing the PostgreSQL instance to handle data insertion.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-drkcn94/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App: Created an inventory and sales order management application using Java, JDBC API, maven, and postgreSQL. The application assists with recording and retrieving inventory details and orders of customers in a database. Testing of the application was done manually and results were compared against queries that were executed with DBeaver. Deployment of the database was done with Docker for the PostgreSQL instance.
  - Grep App: Developed a custom pattern matching search tool inspired by the Unix "grep" command by utilizing the Java language with lambdas and streams and Apache Maven for build and dependency management. Testing of the application was done manually by logging changes in the application's state with SLF4J and Logback. The application was containerized with Docker to make deployment of the application streamlined by reducing potential environment inconsistencies.


## Highlighted Projects
**Web app for Badminton Club Management and Player Statistics (Shuttlestats)** [[GitHub](https://github.com/drkcn94/shuttlestats)]: Currently developing a passion project built with Java, MySQL, and Spring Boot to assist Badminton Club/Group Managers. Testing is done using manual and automated systems such as Postman, JUnit and Mockito. Features included are management duties including tracking of payment history and attendance of players, and player match history/statistics including total win/loss record, and partner win rate/synergy.
