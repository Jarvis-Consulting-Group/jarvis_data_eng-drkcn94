Throughout my years studying in the program and working at Nexolink Inc. for a co-op work term lasting close to a year, I learned practical software development technologies and skills such as Docker, Linux Shell Scripting, Agile \u0026 Scrum and software application design. My knowledge of software development includes Java, Javascript, Spring Boot, SQL, Docker, AWS/GCP, and Git/Github. Previously, my experience was related to project and processes management at a condominium development consulting company where my focus was spent streamlining workflow processes, making sure that projects were proceeding in a timely manner and managing communication between teams and execution of project phases. As a budding junior developer, I am always looking for opportunities to produce software that will assist in running my life and contributing to my career development."
