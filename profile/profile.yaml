# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: From Seneca College, I graduated with a Honours Bachelor of Technology - Software Development. Throughout my years studying in the program and working at Nexolink Inc. for a co-op work term lasting close to a year, I learned practical software development technologies and skills such as Docker, Linux Shell Scripting, Agile & Scrum and software application design. My knowledge of software development includes Java, Javascript, Spring Boot, SQL, Docker, AWS/GCP, and Git/Github. Previously, my experience was related to project and processes management at a condominium development consulting company where my focus was spent streamlining workflow processes, making sure that projects were proceeding in a timely manner and managing communication between teams and execution of project phases. As a budding junior developer, I am always looking for opportunities to produce software that will assist in running my life and contributing to my career development.

The application assists with recording and retrieving inventory details and orders of customers in a database. Testing of the application was done manually and results were compared against queries that were executed with DBeaver. Deployment of the database was done with Docker for the PostgreSQL instance."
      - "Grep App: Developed a custom pattern matching search tool inspired by the Unix \"grep\" command by utilizing the Java language with lambdas and streams and Apache Maven for build and dependency management. Testing of the application was done manually by logging changes in the application's state with SLF4J and Logback. The application was containerized with Docker to make deployment of the application streamlined by reducing potential environment inconsistencies."
