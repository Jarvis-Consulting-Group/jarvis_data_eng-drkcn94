# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: From Seneca College, I graduated with a Honours Bachelor of Technology - Software Development. Throughout my years studying in the program and working at Nexolink Inc. for a co-op work term lasting close to a year, I learned practical software development technologies and skills such as Docker, Linux Shell Scripting, Agile & Scrum and software application design. My knowledge of software development includes Java, Javascript, Spring Boot, SQL, Docker, AWS/GCP, and Git/Github. Previously, my experience was related to project and processes management at a condominium development consulting company where my focus was spent streamlining workflow processes, making sure that projects were proceeding in a timely manner and managing communication between teams and execution of project phases. As a budding junior developer, I am always looking for opportunities to produce software that will assist in running my life and contributing to my career development.
